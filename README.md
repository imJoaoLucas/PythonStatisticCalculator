# PythonStatisticCalculator
A Python script created during my statistics coursework to explore concepts like variance, probability, and data visualization. Built for hands-on practice and future expansion as I deepen my understanding of both Python and statistics.

It's still missing some important features like the menu (making it not usefull yet). But a lot of functions are already implemented.
